     * should call [ErrorHandler.onError] on [errorHandler] instance passed to

     * prints "Hello, R1" 2 times:
     * ```
     *   val consumer: Consumer<String> = { resource ->
     *     println("Hello, $resource")

     *   resourceManager.consumeResource(consumer) // "Hello, R1"
     *   resourceManager.consumeResource(consumer) // "Hello, R1" again
